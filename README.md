## Description

  A card game in which all of the cards are mixed up, laid face down and are flipped face up over each turn. The goal of this game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. After all cards are matched the game will be over and the user can choose to play again or quit the game. This application was made with an MVVM Architecture, using Kotlin coroutines to allow API Requests to get images and display them on the game cards.

### APK

[Memory Game APK](https://github.com/thaislins/memory-game/blob/app_images/images/app-debug.apk)

### Features

* Repository and datasource were used as part of the model in the MVVM architechture,
as a way to keep the app modularized and easier to maintain
* Used Room to save product data and game scores in database
* Used Material Design Components
* Kotlin Coroutines were used to make API requests and to access app database
* Made use of Viewmodel, Livedata and DataBinding to make interaction with view easier and to retain data

  * Used to help decouple code and to reduce boilerplate code by injecting 
  repositories, viewmodel and retrofit interfaces
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) - Image Loading Framework
  * This library was used to load the images from src links obtained from a GET request
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - REST Client Library
